# Resume-Parser-using-NLP
 Implemented a working system for different machine learning models using tf-idf vectorizer and cosine similary to:
  - determine how closely (in percentage) oneâ€™s resume matches various job descriptions
  - predict the category (Job Role) to which the resume is best fitted for 
  - calculate the similarity bettween a resume and a job description, predict the category and display the top three categories in which the resume belongs.
